<h1>Sude Yüksek</h1>
<p>Sude Yüksek was born in Istanbul's Beykoz district, known as the “pearl of the Bosphorus” with its 18th and 19th-century houses and pretty, still largely unspoiled coastline, dotted with fishermen’s boats. She speaks French, English and Turkish fluently and writes in all three languages.She took her first steps in coding at the age of 12 when she designed a 3D game. She is currently studying Computer Engineering at Marmara University in Istanbul. Her hobbies include drawing, painting and reading the classics. She has explored 20 countries including several continents such as Asia, Europe and Africa, from Cape of Good Hope to Bangkok with her family, giving her the opportunity to meet different people and observe different cultures since her childhood. When asked how she gets her inspiration as a developer, she answers that her favourite time to code, is “when I find a quiet place, where I can take small, gentle sips from a coffee thinking about the process in front of me and my past experiences; melting them into one unified solution, in a harmonious way, just as a perfect combination of nature and nurture”.</p>
